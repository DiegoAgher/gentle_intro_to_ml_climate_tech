By using weather predictions, we can ensure the battery is charged when solar power is unavailable.\n","\n","\n","### Thought experiment\n","Think of another other Climate-focused prediction / automation.\n","* What would be interesting to predict?\n","  * Why would it be interesting?\n","  * What would be the value of it?\n","* Are you solving a problem?

That is, I \"know\" what the model \"should\" say when I use certain data as input, since I have the answer. And since that is the case, I can correct what the model says if I know it's answer was wrong.
